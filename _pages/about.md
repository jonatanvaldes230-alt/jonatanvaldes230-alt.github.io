 I'm from Miami, Florida. Enrolling into Cyber Security has always been something that interested me I joined the military right out of highschool, there are a lot of similarities between the two fields i view cyber security as a battle field and it seemed like a good choice in proffession i can enjoy. my aspirations are to grow in the field of intelegence gathering and using that information to defend against attacks from someone who is trying to do harm.
